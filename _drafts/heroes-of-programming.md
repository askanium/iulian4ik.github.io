In the past, heroes fought terrible monsters, cunning villains and mighty enemies.

Today? We don't have monsters and enemies and villains are rarely fought alone.

However, today we have our own "monsters" to fight, villains to handle and enemies to crush: 

- tight deadlines
- pesky clients
- tired managers
- ambiguity
- complexity of projects

Can we do this alone? Hardly. But with its ingenuity, humanity have discovered and created many allies that help it in its quest of evolving into a [planetary civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_civilization).

From paper to gunpowder to steam engine to electromagnetism to computers to data science - every discovery or creation made people's lifes better, helped them overcome the existing challenges, creating new ones at the same time. And we make use of these creations of ours without realizing how much they aid us in our lifes. But if to remove them, the impact on our lifestyle would be devastating. Simply imagine how would you spend three days without electricity.

One of such creations is Programming. It helps us a lot. It saves us millions of hours of work, making computations faster and with less errors, giving us the possibility to focus on creating more things. But it wouldn't have been possible without some clear rules, without the desire to build something great, without some _heroes_ at work.

## Heroes of Programming

Meet them, they are the heroes that help us meet the deadlines, deal with clients, ambiguity and complexity:

Oh, and one more thing. In order to work great as a team, they need a coordinator, a leader, a hero of their own - they need You to organize them.

So **join** The Heroes of Programming and **become** a Hero.

Sooner or later in their careers, every developer hears about them. For some, this is the first and the last step of getting to know about design patterns. However, those who want to grow as professionals and improve their skills, go to the next step and actually read about them and learn their concepts. The last step, at which even fewer arrive in their journey is that of mastery - when you have procedural knowledge on how, when and where to use these design patterns and when you can choose the best option suitable for the task. 

The margin between the second and third steps is blurred though. We can read about design patterns and immediately try to apply them to some of our projects and we're already somewhere in the middle. But mastery comes with time, in the process of continuous improvement, when you understand them and the principles behind these design patterns. When you make mistakes, fix them and then analyze what you have learned.

The following series of posts aims at the second step of the journey - explaining the basic concepts regarding the software design patterns. The list of design patterns will be based on the **"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"** book written by _Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides,_ who are often referred to as the Gang of Four (GoF). The list, however, is not an exhaustive one, as there are other software design patterns that are not presented in the book. The patterns are divided into three categories: 

1. Creational patterns - these facilitate the object creation process.
2. Structural patterns - these facilitate object and class composition.
3. Behavioral patterns - these facilitate the communication and behavior between objects.

In order to facilitate understanding of these patterns, we'll teleport to the fantasy world of [Middle-earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth) and create some analogies to situations in which one or another pattern would be appropriate to use. But be prepared, sometimes we'll have to code for the dark side as well.

So, here's the list of the patterns:

### Creational patterns

1. [Abstract factory pattern](/patterns/abstract-factory/)
2. [Builder pattern](/patterns/builder/)
3. Factory method pattern
4. [Prototype pattern](/patterns/prototype/)
5. Singleton pattern

### Structural patterns

1. Adapter
2. Bridge
3. Composite
4. Decorator
5. Facade
6. Flyweight
7. Proxy

### Behavioral patterns

1. Chain of responsibility
2. Command
3. Interpreter
4. Iterator
5. Mediator
6. Memento
7. Observer
8. State
9. Strategy
10. Template method
11. Visitor

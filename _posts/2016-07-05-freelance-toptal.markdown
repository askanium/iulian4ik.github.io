Why do people choose the IT domain? Or, to be more specific, why people choose a software or web developer career? Most probably, you, dear reader, are in the IT field as well. Why did **you** chose it?

There are many answers to this question, but one thing that unites them all is the possibility to create. We all love to create things. And this desire for creation has its roots in our childhood. When being little, we create sand castles, lego constructions, doll houses and many more. We also had dreams to build something big and wonderful, but we were little kids and couldn't make some of our plans reality.

Now, however, we have much more power. A developer career provides practically unlimited possibilities to create things! Recall how many times you've heard from one of your non IT friends: "Is it possible to implement this?" I always answer: "Almost everything is possible, it depends on how much time there is." 

This ability to create goes hand in hand with flexibility. Things can be done in different ways, which is also great, because we are all different and some things we enjoy doing our way.

I've worked as a full stack web developer for 6 years. Mainly, I wrote Python and JavaScript, but also did some projects in Java and Excel VBA and the projects I've done range from small Excel scripts that saved tens of man-hours per month to huge projects that were used by whole departments to platforms as a service used by many companies. And you know what? I've enjoyed each of these projects, because they helped people do their job easier/faster/you name it.

But recently I've come to a moment in life when I decided to leave my full time job to pursue a freelance career. This wasn't an easy decision, but after making a simple analysis of what are + and - of leaving and + and - of staying, I realised that for me it was an option. 

Some of the advantages of being a freelancer are:

- **You skip commutes.** I was spending 1 to 1.5 hours to get to office. Now, I know that it's not too much, but hey, you can do __a lot__ of productive work in 1.5 hours;
- **You have more time to spend with your family.** At different times in my career, I worked for up to 14 hours a day. Being a freelancer you have more control of your free time. (I admit that I might be wrong here, as I didn't work as a freelancer yet, but it's what it seems like from aside);
- **You can work your hours.** Some people are productive in the evening, some early in the morning. Again, it depends on the type of freelance work you find, but generally speaking, you have more flexibility here as well.

So, it was an option for me. But, as it often happens, there is one **but** - you need to actually find a freelance opportunity and __get selected__ for it. The competition is huge in the freelance landscape. There are lots of platforms where you can register as a freelancer, but still the competition is enormous.

But there is one place in the internet universe that differentiated itself in an interesting way. I've heard about it by word of mouth from one of my friends. I believe that it is one of the most effective marketing channels (because I trust my friend) and I checked it out as soon as I arrived home.

I'm talking about [TopTal.com](https://www.toptal.com). What is interesting about them and caught my attention is their positioning:

>Hire the top 3% of freelance talent.

This one sentence addresses several psychological aspects of freelancers as well as companies:

1. It boosts freelancer's status (he/she is in top 3% of all developers!);
2. It increases the certainty for the company that finds freelancers through TopTal that they'll actually do their job and do it properly;
3. Once you went through the selection process (where the competition is even higher), the competition will be lower than on other platforms (at least it feels like so).

What is also great about TopTal is their content - they write blog posts on different topics that are all of high quality. So it's a complex solution to freelancer problems - it's a place where you can offer your services and continuously improve your skills. And by the way, their clients are companies like Airbnb and Zendesk.

I've just applied to TopTal.com to become part of the [web freelancers group](https://www.toptal.com/web) and I'm looking forward to the next steps required to become a member of TopTal community. I believe it's gonna be a great experience. And if you are looking for a job right now, or want to switch to freelance, give it a try. You won't lose anything, but you can win a lot.

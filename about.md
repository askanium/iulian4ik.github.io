Welcome to the club of programmers who want to become great programmers! "Programming for Kettles" comes from a russian idiom that is translated as "Programming for Dummies." However, the intent of this website is not to consider you a dummy, but to explain different programming concepts in a simple and understandable way.

## A short bio

My name is Iulian Gulea and I'm a developer from Moldova (have you even heard about this country?) that wraps his head around different concepts of programming. 

I have 5 years of experience in developing web apps. Currently my tech stack is *Python/Django + Django REST Framework* on the backend and *AngularJS* on the frontend. I also like visualizing things using *D3.js.*

Besides programming, however, I have 8 years of experience in training and development. I've worked for 5 years at an internationnal telco company as a Training and Quality of Sales coordinator and have 3 years of training experience in the NGO sector (AIESEC Moldova/Ukraine). Although writing is not the same as delivering a training, I hope that my experience in training will contribute to clear and useful posts.

And besides all that, I am passionate about Machine Learning.

## Why this site exists

When working as a trainer, I was (and currently am) passionate about learning processes. I believe (and numerous research proves it) that when you want to learn something, the fastest way is to get your hands dirty and practice/do it. And as the old saying goes:

>If you can't explain it simply you don't understand it well enough.

And this is the place where I will try to explain things in a simple manner.
